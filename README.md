# cs4241-FinalProject

For your final project, you'll implement a course project that exhibits your mastery of the course materials. 
Similar to A4, this project gives you an opportunity to be creative and to pursue individual research and learning.

## General description

Your project should consist of a complete Web application, exhibiting facets of the three main sections of the course material:

- Static Web page content and design. You should have a project that is accessible, easily navigable, and features significant content.
- Dynamic behavior implemented with JavaScript.
- Server-side programming *using Node.js*. Typically this will take the form of some sort of persistent data, authentication, and possibly server-side computation.

Additionally, you should incorporate features that you independently research, design, and implement for your project.

## Project ideation

Excellent projects serve someone/some group; for this assignment you need to define your users and stakeholders. I encourage you to identify projects that will have impact, either artistically, politically, or in terms of productivity. Consider creating something useful for a cause or hobby you care about.

## Logistics

### Team size
Students are encouraged to work in teams of 2-5 students for the project. This will allow you to build a good project without expending an excessive amount of effort. While I would expect a team of four or five students to produce a project with more features, I expect a every team's work to exhibit all of the required facets described above.

### Deliverables

__Proposal:__ 
Provide an outline of your project direction and the names of the team members. 
The outline should have enough detail so that staff can determine if it meets the minimum expectations, or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline.
This file must be named proposal.md so we can find it.
Submit a PR to turn it in by Monday, September 30th, before class

There are no other scheduled checkpoints for your project. 
You must be done in time to present before the final project demo day (October 10th). 

#### Turning in Your Outline / Project

**NOTE: code is due before the project presentation day due to the end of term / grading schedule constraints**
Submit a second PR on the final project repo to turn in your app and code.

Deploy your app, in the form of a webpage, to Glitch/Heroku/Digital Ocean or some other service.
Folks on the same team do not need to post the same webpage, but must instead clearly state who is on the team in their proposal.

The README for your second pull request doesn’t need to be a formal report, but it should contain:

1. A brief description of what you created, and a link to the project itself.
2. Any additional instructions that might be needed to fully use your project (login information etc.)
3. An outline of the technologies you used and how you used them.
4. What challenges you faced in completing the project.
5. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.

Think of 1,3, and 4 in particular in a similar vein to the design / tech achievements for A1—A4… make a case for why what you did was challenging and why your implementation deserves a grade of 100%.

## Final Presentation

Presentations will occur during the final day of class in *Riley Commons*.

## FAQs

- **Can I use XYZ framework?** You can use any web-based frameworks or tools available, but for your server programming you need to use node.js.
