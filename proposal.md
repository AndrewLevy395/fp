_Online Codenames Multiplayer Game!_
For our Final Project, we plan on implementing an online version of the card game codenames which will allow users to play together online and create their own cards and play styles.

## Codenames
Rules of codenames: https://howdoyouplayit.com/codename-rules-how-do-you-play-the-codename-board-game/

## This project will feature:
- HTML static pages and validations for form input, as well as for the tracking sheet interface itself.
- A login feature, which allows users to log in and edit/produce their own personal card decks.
- A Node.js SQLite database which hold all of the login and card deck info for all users.
- Dynamic Javascript that will implement selectors and buttons for selecting and making cards in game as well as communicating with teammates (if necessary) 
- Javascript to interact (add/modify/remove) with the database. 
- Card presets, which will allow users to play the game without needing to create their own deck (if they so choose)

## Goals for this Project:
- Create a fun interactive game that people can play online.
- Utilize web sockets to allow for realtime communication between players, browser, and the server.
- Allow players customization options for the game that paying with cards in real life does not offer.
